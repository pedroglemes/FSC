# FSC
Streamlit app for a PBL activity on FSC certification. Students act as consultants for a forestry company facing pest control issues and must develop a complete ESRA (Environmental &amp; Social Risk Assessment). They interview simulated company sectors, gather data, and integrate technical research to produce the final assessment.
